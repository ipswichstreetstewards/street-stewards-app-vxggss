You want to create a mobile app for \"street stewards\" to track their clean-up activities, connect with other users, identify plants and hazards, and organize community events. The app should have a light, fun, and environmentally friendly theme. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Profile Creation and Management:** Users can create and manage their street steward profile, including their adopted street(s) and contact information.\n-   **Clean-up Logging:** A system to log clean-up activities, including date, time, location, and amount of trash collected. This will integrate with a point system to gamify the experience.\n-   **Photo Posting:** Users can post photos of hazards, plant life, or before-and-after clean-ups, with integration for sharing on social media.\n-   **User Activity Tracking:** Display other users' activities and highlight the most frequent users.\n-   **Hazard Reporting:** Users can report hazards like potholes or debris with photo uploads and location data.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Background: #F5F5DC (Beige)\n    -   Text: #333333 (Dark Gray)\n    -   TextSecondary: #666666 (Medium Gray)\n    -   Primary: #8FBC8F (Light Green)\n    -   Secondary: #2E8B57 (Sea Green)\n    -   Accent: #ADD8E6 (Light Blue)\n    -   Card: #FFFFFF (White)\n    -   Highlight: #90EE90 (Lime Green)\n-   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx:**\n    -   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is not needed for the core functionality of the app.\n\nNow, I'll instruct the coding agent to implement the plan.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, remember to enable Supabase if you want to add backend functionality such as databases, storage, or authentication. You can do this by pressing the Supabase button and connecting to a project. You might need to create one in Supabase first.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-26T17:43:53.269067"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build this Street Steward app!
